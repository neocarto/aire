    reprDescriptions:
      stock: "The stock map is used to represent quantitative raw or absolute data through a proportional symbol."
      ratio: "The ratio data are quantitative data calculated from raw data which made the report. Their shape forms choropleth maps."
      stockRatio: "This type of representation gives on the same map the representation of raw data and data which made the report."
      ratioDisc: "The display of discontinuitiesâ€™ lines can highlight the failures of the spatial socio-economic phenomena studied."
      cartogram: "Representation by anamorphosis can distort the territorial units according to the value of the raw data being studied."
      ratioGrid: "The gridded map is a way to get rid of the arbitrary and irregular administrative division and to highlight the major trends in spatial distribution."
      potential: "The smoothed map (using the method of potential) allows to visualize spatial phenomena on a continuous basis, by freeing completely the underlying territorial network."
