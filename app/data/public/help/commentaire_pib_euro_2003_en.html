In 2003, the Gross Domestic Product of 29 studied Europeans countries (15 EU members, 12 candidates countries, Switzerland and Norway) reach 21 000 Euros per inhabitant and per year. This mean value is not really significant. There are some very huge contrasts which mask large differences between and within countries.
<br><br>

GDP per inhabitant of European region {move:ratio_nuts23:102325:253015:0}[VIEW]{/move}, revealed various and extremely high contrasts between rich regions (located on North and West) and poor regions (located on East and South). Contrasts seem here even stronger measured in ‘Euros per inhabitant’ instead of ‘purchasing power parities’. It means that we compare the monetary income of regions without taking into account differences of cost of living (100 Euros doesn’t allow buying the same quantity of goods in a rich country like Norway or in a poorest country like Bulgaria). The French department Paris reaches 72 000 Euros per inhabitant (more than 3 times the European mean) while Bulgarian regions don’t exceed 2000 Euros per inhabitant (less than one tenth of the European mean).
This map doesn’t show all the inequalities of wealth in Europe and some others variations lead to a better understanding of their multiple dimensions.

<b>International differences (NW)</b>
<br><br>

Before studying regional differences, it’s necessary to have a close look at the wealth differentials between states. The global wealth of nation could be mapped in several ways depending on whether consideration has been given to its volume (raw data) or its intensity (ratio data). If we focus on the quantity of wealth generated by each country in 2003 {move:stock_nuts0:-636337 :13858:1}[VIEW]{/move}, obviously reunified Germany ranks highest among the European countries (2161 billions of Euros), followed by United Kingdom, France and Italy (between 1300 and 1600 billions of Euros). Small countries, like Luxembourg or Slovenia don’t seem to weigh so heavily in the balance with only 25 billions of Euros which is 80 times less than Germany.

<br><br>
If conversely the interest is focused on the wealth per capita of European countries in 2003 {move:ratio_nuts0:-636337 :13858:1}[VIEW]{/move}, the ranking doesn’t anymore depend on country sizes. Aren’t necessarily the biggest countries which score best result? Indeed, it’s the “small” Luxembourg which score the highest rank with 569 000 Euros per capita, more than the double of the European mean. It is followed by Norway, Denmark and Ireland. The poorest countries shall be those which have entered lately in the European Union, Bulgaria and Romania (with less than 2500 Euros per capita).

<br><br>
There is no clear link between economic size among countries and their wealth per capita {move:stockandratio_nuts0:-636337 :13858:1}[VIEW]{/move}. Among the largest European countries, we find richer countries than the European mean (France, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom) and some others not as rich (Poland, Spain, Romania). Nevertheless, it’s in the smallest countries that we can found the most extreme situations with countries which are of well above average of wealth per capita (Luxembourg, Ireland) or far below (Baltic states).

<br><br>
<b>Interregional differences and European mesh level (N1, N2, and N3)</b>
<br><br>

If we look at the reference map {move:ratio_nuts23:-333606:153114 :2}[VIEW]{/move} which measure regional differences between spatial units similar in size, we can suggest another set of maps which will show regional differences inside official European mesh (NUTS). The Nomenclature of Territorial Statistical Units presents 3 regional breakdowns: NUTS 1, NUTS2, and NUTS3.
<br><br>

At NUTS1 level {move:ratio_nuts1:-333606:153114 :2}[VIEW]{/move}, the regional economic differences are well noticeable in countries like Germany (opposition between western and eastern Landers), Italy (opposition between the rich northern Italy and the Mezzogiorno), or Belgium (opposition between Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels). This level of analysis fits well to set main oppositions inside bigger countries with high internal contrasts and often with a federal organization.
<br><br>

At NUTS2 level, {move:ratio_nuts2:-333606:153114 :2}[VIEW]{/move}, new differentiations are highlighted and the specific situation of metropolitan regions are more visible. In Germany, for example, Munich region is differentiates among all Bavaria Landers. Even if they don’t fit with relative pertinent governance level (German Bezirkes have no power), NUTS2 level is a fundamental issue for European Union as it is the main entry point for monitoring premium payments to regions that are lagging behind in their development, in other words, the poorest regions.
<br><br>

At NUTS3 level, {move:ratio_nuts3:-333606:153114 :2}[VIEW]{/move}, local differences are highlighted showing clear opposition between urban, periurban and rural areas. This holds true only in countries where territorial division is thin (i.e. German Kreis). In other countries, territorial division in NUTS3 is much larger (like in French departments). At that level, economic differences are more or less artificial: GDP per capita is measured within the place of production instead the place of consumption. A city, which concentrates corporate headquarters, could display a very high GDP per capita while its inhabitants are poor (case of Brussels). Conversely, a comfort of fancy suburb may have a very low GDP per capita with really wealthy populations.
<br><br>

<b>Demographic weight and wealth per capita in European regions</b>
<br><br>

Mapping only GDP per capita {move:ratio_nuts2:102325:253015:0}[VIEW]{/move} may provide a visual impression of a large and rich space formed by Scandinavian countries because of the large visual area because of its geographical extent and its intensity. In fact, these are unpopulated areas where wealth, measured in volume, is not so high. Two kinds of mapping lead to a clearer understanding of the real economic weight of regions.
<br><br>

Maps that combine population and wealth per capita of regions {move:stockandratio_nuts2:102325:253015:0}[VIEW]{/move} may put the level of wealth in perspective showing which population is concerned. Norwegian regions are, for example, very rich when measuring it with GDP per capita but it concerns very few people. Conversely, Polish regions are poorest but inhabitants are more numerous.
<br><br>

Anamorphosis maps {move:cartogram_nuts2:102325:253015:0}[VIEW]{/move} highlight this phenomenon because they distort region areas to make them proportional to their population. Thus, it shows in a more accurate way the rich and populated areas like Ile de France or the poor and populated areas like Sicilia.

<br><br>

<b>Boundaries and discontinuities</b>
<br><br>

Are wealth per capita differentials higher between neighborhood regions? Are maps showing a smooth transition from very rich regions to very poor by a number of intermediate regions? Or are they any discontinuities linking very rich and very poor regions on both sides of some borders?
<br><br>

Economic discontinuities are higher between old and new European Union members {move:disc_nuts0:415422:-39930:1}[VIEW]{/move}. Specifically, we notice very rough contrasts between Germany and Poland, Austria and Slovakia, or Greece and Bulgaria.
<br><br>

Economic discontinuities between Nuts 2 level regions {move:disc_nuts2:415422:-39930:1}[VIEW]{/move} enhance very clearly border between old and new member states. Ratio of wealth of population from west and east of the iron curtain can reach 2, 3, 4, or even more! But, we also find discontinuities inside some countries where the capital region is much richer than the neighbouring regions (Paris, London, Bucharest, Prague, etc.). Finally, we notice the special case of Luxembourg, much richer than the regions around it: French, German, or Belgium regions which attracts work force.
<br><br>

<b>Regional stocks and wealth potentials</b>
<br><br>

If we are concerned by the amount of wealth produced at local level inside Europe, 2 approaches may be complementary and possible.
<br><br>

Mapping regional GDP measured in volume {move:stock_nuts23:-309969:-152266:1}[VIEW]{/move} allow highlighting the regions which are economically stronger. But, instead of countries level {move:stock_nuts0:-309969:-152266:1}[VIEW]{/move}, their weight is always more or less arbitrary due to uncertainties of the territorial division (View {move:stock_nuts1:-309969:-152266:1}[NUTS1]{/move}, {move:stock_nuts2:-309969:-152266:1}[NUTS2]{/move}, {move:stock_nuts3:-309969:-152266:1}[NUTS3]{/move}). Economic weight of a region will depend on the type of zoning.
<br><br>

Mapping potential GDP in a neighbourhood of 80 km {move:smooth_p80:102325:253015:0}[VIEW]{/move} allow to better visualize local economic concentrations in Europe because they use a single and same rule in order to measure, in respect of all parts of areas, quantity of economic activities all around. We see clearly a European backbone, from London to Milano passing by Benelux and Rhine axis. We can also mention the exceptional economic weight of Paris and the large metropolitan areas (Madrid, Barcelona, Warsaw, Athens, Stockholm, etc.). Of course, it’s possible to vary the scope of the potential to identify more local {move:smooth_p40:102325:253015:0}[40km]{/move} or more global {move:smooth_p160:102325:253015:0}[160km]{/move} economic concentrations.
